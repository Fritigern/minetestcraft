About
~~~~~
This mod adds a bed to Minetest which allows to skip the night. To sleep rightclick the bed, if playing 
in singleplayer mode the night gets skipped imideatly. If playing on server you get shown how many other
players are in bed too. If all players are sleeping the night gets skipped aswell. Also the night skip can be forced
if more than 50% of the players are lying in bed and use this option.

Another feature is a controled respawning. If you have slept in bed (not just lying in it) your respawn point
is set to the beds location. If dying you will respawn there.



You can craft two types of beds:


Simple shaped bed:

wool wool wool
wood wood wood

Fancy shaped bed:

wool wool stick
wood wood wood

Notice: You can use any color of wood or wool, mixing different is also possible.
