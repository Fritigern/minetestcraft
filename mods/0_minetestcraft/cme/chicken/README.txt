================================
Copyright (c) 2015 BlockMen <blockmen2015@gmail.com>

Version: 2.0 Beta


Adds chicken to Minetest (requires Creatures MOB-Engine).
Chicken spawn on dirt and grass blocks, have 5 HP and are friendly. When killed they
drop meat, which can be eaten or cooked. Also they drop randomly eggs (which have
no real use yet.)
