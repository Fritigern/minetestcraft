New village type for https://github.com/Sokomine/mg_villages/

This mod does depend on mg_villages.

The buildings found in this mod (in the schems/ folder) have been built by
LadyMacBeth and where originally created for Mauvebics mm2 modpack. That
modpack contained an attempt to create villages as well.

If you want to use this village type, get the mm2 modpack from somewhere
and read https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=1598

You might also have to change the depends.txt file found in mg_villages by
turning the dependency "farming" into "farming?" (add the question mark so
that the dependency becomes optional).
