MINETESTCRAFT
=============

A game for Minetest, intended to have a familiar feel to people migrating from "that other mining game".
Basically, this is an attempt to put together a game that comes as close to the MC gameplay and experience as possible. this means that I sometimes choose to use mod "Y" instead of the more popular or newer mod "X".

This game is set up like a modpack, so that you can choose to move the mods to your global mods folder.

INSTALLING
==========
The first and preferred way of installing this game is to use the following command, issued in your minetest/games folder:
	git clone https://github.com/Fritigern/minetestcraft minetestcraft
Then whenever you want to check for updates, go to the minetestcraft folder and issue the following command:
	git pull

The second way which it not as easy to update as the git clone way, is to download the archive from:
	https://github.com/Fritigern/minetestcraft/archive/master.zip
and extract the contents to the games folder, and rename the folder from minetestcraft-master to minetestcraft.
